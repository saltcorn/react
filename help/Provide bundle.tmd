You can either provide your React code and let the system bundle it, or supply your own bundle.js file. The file must be located in a **dist** folder within your **Code source** location. Additionally, please use React version 19 and expose an `App` component in the global scope. Example:

```javascript
import React from "react";

function App({ tableName, viewName, 
  state, query, rows }) { 
    ... 
}

window.App = App;
```
